     <P><strong>
        A scent of unexpected contrasts and surprising harmonies, a masculine and boldly seductive Eau de Toilette. From icy cold to luxuriously warm,
        BLV Pour Homme is a fresh, woody and spicy Eau de Toilette. A massive square bottle, framed with vibrant blue transparency.
    </p>
    <p>
        First of all, there is a slight masculine smell of cold alcohol in the beginning. But it doesn't have a pungent or light scent. 
        Rather, it feels soft and calm. It's like the smell of a man that's for sure. It's a scent that reminds me of the image of my church brother. 
        It's a scent that I think the person I want to talk to will spray. Usually, the top notes of perfumes are not good, but this perfume feels good.
     </p>   
     <p>   
        Over time, the unique smell of alcohol disappears. And the tenderness of the incense grows deeper. Comparing it to color, it's not a refreshing feeling of blue, 
        but a manly scent that seems to be mixed with navy and gray. It's not disgusting even though it's a scent that keeps gender identity firmly male. Far from disgusting, 
        I want to be grown-up, cozy and cuddly. Even though I've never worn this perfume, I feel like I've smelled it on the street.
