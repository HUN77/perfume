     <strong><U>Perfume</U> (UK: /ˈpɜːfjuːm/, US: /pərˈfjuːm/; French: parfum) is a mixture of fragrant essential oils or aroma compounds,
     fixatives and solvents, usually in liquid form, used to give the human body, animals, food, objects, and living-spaces an agreeable scent.
     
     <P>The 1939 Nobel Laureate for Chemistry, Leopold Ružička claimed in 1945 that "right from the earliest days of scientific chemistry up to 
     the present time perfumes have substantially contributed to the development of organic chemistry as regards methods, systematic classification,
     and theory."
    </P>Ancient texts and archaeological excavations show the use of perfumes in some of the earliest human civilizations. Modern perfumery
    began in the late 19th century with the commercial synthesis of aroma compounds such as vanillin or coumarin, which allowed for the composition of 
    perfumes with smells previously unattainable solely from natural aromatics.
    <P>The word perfume derives from the Latin perfumare, meaning "to smoke through". Perfumery, as the art of making perfumes, began in ancient Mesopotamia,
     Egypt, the Indus Valley Civilization and possibly Ancient China. It was further refined by the Romans and the Muslims.
    The world's first-recorded chemist is considered to be a woman named Tapputi, a perfume maker mentioned in a cuneiform tablet from the 2nd millennium 
    BC in Mesopotamia. She distilled flowers, oil, and calamus with other aromatics, then filtered and put them back in the still several times.</P>
